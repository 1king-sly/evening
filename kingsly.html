    <h1>STARTING TO USE VS CODE</h1>
    <p>This is a new experience that I have just started to learn of and I can say it's simply amazing</p>
<p>Hopefully before the end of this week I will learn of Java and python programming</p>

<h2>PERFECTING MY SKILLS</h2>
<P>Practice makes perfect and this is what I am proving<br> By practicing daily until I fully master the concepts and techniques</P>
<p><b><i>IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME</i></b></p>
